			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of Lab 6 was to work with our partner to experiment with arrays and objects in javascript. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>We ran into a few problems in the javascript console, such as forgetting commas. Our minor mistakes were easily corrected. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I was thorough while completing this assignment. I was easily able to transport my information from javascript console to vscode. My partner and I collaborated well and our outputs are functioning properly, therefore I am proud of the results of this lab.</p>
