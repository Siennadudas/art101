			<h1>Lab 4: Pseudocoding and Problem-solving</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab:</p>
					<p>Every task in day to day life, no matter the level of difficulty can be broken up into simple steps. This makes achieving your goal much more manageable.</p>
					<p>First I wrote pseudocode for a unique everyday task.</p>
					<p>Then, I wrote pseudocode for a simple computer game</p>
					<p>I turned my pseudocode into JS comments by creating a JS file in my lab JS folder.</p>
					<p>I added pseudocodes as lists to my lab4.html file to demonstrate what I've learned.</p>

			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>My partner stopped responding at the last minute, so for this lab I'm going solo.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I chose a fun everyday task that I have been obsessed with recently: blueberry pancakes. The best blueberry pancakes. I am relieved to now have the recipe in an accessible location.</p>
					<p>I enjoyed learning about the pseudocoding process, it is very helpful to organize my ideas. I plan to use this technique in my life with any tasks I'd like to do. This lab was easier to complete than previous because I had a detailed and well structured plan for my work.</p>
					<p>Initially, I planned for a chess game but got confused along the way so I opted for a simple tic-tac-toe game.</p>
					<p>When I was breaking down the steps for building the game I got confused, yet was able to simplize even further and create a step by step pseudocode.</p>
					<p>Implementing nested lists helped me structure my lists and make them easier to read.</p>

					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>The Best Blueberry Pancakes Recipe</p>
					<p>Ingredients:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>1 egg</li>
						<li>1.5 cups almond milk</li>
						<li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
						<li>3 tablespoons melted butter</li>
						<li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
						<li>1/4 cup brown sugar</li>
						<li>1.5 cups flour</li>
						<li>1 cup blueberries</li>
						<li>a pinch of salt</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Step by Step Instructions:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>1. Beat the egg in a large bowl. Add almond milk, vanilla extract, and melted butter and whisk until combined.</li>
						<li>2. Add the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt. Whisk until batter is smooth and evenly combined.</li>
			            <li>3. Mix in your blueberries.</li>
						<li>4. Heat up a large pan to medium heat and coat evenly with butter.</li>
						<li>5. Use 1/4 measuring cup to scoop batter onto preheated pan. Cook pancakes 1-2 minutes on each side.</li>
						<li>6. Serve with buter and maple syrup, enjoy!</li>
					</ul>
			</div>
					<p>Creating a simple chess game:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>1. Print clean board before each game</li>
						<li>2. Accept input from user</li>
						<li>3. Player move begins</li>
						<ul>Evaluate moves</ul>
						<ul>Create inputs for user to choose from:</ul>
						<ul>- Rock</ul>
						<ul>- Paper</ul>
						<ul>- Scissors</ul>
						<ul>Create graphics for R, P, S</ul>
						<li>4. Choose final move</li>
						<li>5. Computer recieves input from user and randomly generates a number 1-3:</li>
						<ul>- 1=rock</ul>
						<ul>- 2=paper</ul>
						<ul>- 3=scissors</ul>
						<li>6. Results are displayed</li>
						<ul>- Graphics "you win/you loose" based on results</ul>
						<li>7. Option for rematch</li>
					</ul>
