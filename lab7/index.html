            <h1>Lab 7: Functions</h1>
            <h2>Challenge:</h2>
            <p>The challenge of the lab was to create a working function. The function takes the username input and sorts the letters into a new name.</p>
            <h2>Problems:</h3>
            <p>I ran into some problems in my javascript file that took trial/error and patience to fix. My mistakes were simple such as formatting and spelling. These are easy to overlook, the only solution is to re-check my work over and over until it runs.</p>
            <h2>Results:</h4>
            <p>My results are shown in this index.html page. The script output below shows the results of my function.</p>
