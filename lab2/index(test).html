		<h1>Hello World!</h1>
		<p>Hi, my name is Sienna. I am a film & digital media major and plan to minor in dance or theater arts to continue my lifelong passion for ballet. I have two cats, Clover and Gorpicus. I love spending time in nature whether it be camping, hiking, or exploring. I love to crochet, read, and cook/bake in my free time!</p>

					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>In Lab 2 I edited my html page, adding a title, an image, and a body paragraph. I added a photo of my cat, Clover, and changed the headers and sections purple.</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I had trouble getting it to run in the browser, so had to go back and edit the html document multiple times until it worked. </p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This lab took a lot of trial and erorr which taught me patience and I was able to get more familar with html. I put my best effort into my work, this is new to me so it took my all. Unfortunatley, I was unable to work with a partner for this assigment but the positive side of that is that I was able to take ample time to fully understand each element. Watching the html introductory videos prior to completing the lab really helped. </p>
