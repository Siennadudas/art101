			<h1>Lab 3: File Structure & File Transfer</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of Lab 3 was to manage file structures. I created links connecting my homepage to the lab pages and have gained a further understanding of web design.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I had some trouble linking my homepage but soon realized I was just putting the wrong page. Mostly all my errors were simple mistakes that I had to go back and look for in order to locate. I have learned that coding is very precise and you have to pay attention to every detail.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I had fun completing this lad and I felt much more confident then when working on lab 1. It was accomplishing for me to merely understand the prompt. I created a simple yet aesthetically pleasing homepage with a cool photo of me and added links to Labs 1-6. I made a few edits to my Lab 2 page based on feedback from my partner. This included the background color and font sizing. I am pleased with how it looks after the adjustments.</p>
